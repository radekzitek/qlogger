Proposing a Risk Library for Information Technology and Information Systems Risk Management in an EU Bank
1. Introduction: The Imperative for a Robust IT and IS Risk Library in the EU Banking Sector
The operational landscape of banking within the European Union (EU) is increasingly reliant on sophisticated Information Technology (IT) and Information Systems (IS) for the execution of core banking functions, the facilitation of customer interactions, and the adherence to a complex web of regulatory requirements. This heightened dependence on digital infrastructure has simultaneously amplified the potential for disruptions stemming from a diverse array of threats. These threats encompass not only sophisticated cyberattacks and data breaches but also operational failures within intricate IT ecosystems. The consequences of such incidents can be severe, potentially leading to significant financial losses, damage to reputation, and systemic instability within the financial sector. Consequently, EU regulators are placing an ever-increasing emphasis on the need for financial institutions to adopt proactive and robust risk management strategies specifically targeting their IT and IS environments.
In this context, the establishment of a comprehensive risk library emerges as a critical tool for EU banks. A risk library serves as a centralized and structured repository designed to facilitate the systematic identification, classification, assessment, mitigation, and ongoing tracking of IT and IS-related risks. By providing a unified framework for managing these risks, a well-designed risk library can significantly enhance an organization's overall risk awareness. This improved awareness, in turn, supports more informed decision-making processes at all levels of the bank, enabling a more effective allocation of resources towards risk mitigation efforts. Furthermore, a robust risk library is instrumental in demonstrating compliance with the evolving and increasingly stringent IT and IS resilience requirements mandated by EU regulatory bodies. Therefore, the creation and maintenance of a comprehensive risk library is not merely an administrative or compliance task but rather a strategic necessity for ensuring the operational resilience and long-term sustainability of EU banks in the face of a dynamic and challenging risk landscape.
This report aims to address the critical need for a structured approach to IT and IS risk management in EU banks by proposing a detailed framework for a risk library tailored to the specific requirements of the EU regulatory environment. The subsequent sections of this report will delve into the essential components of such a library, starting with the definition of a relevant and comprehensive risk classification framework. Following this, the report will detail the necessary data structures for effectively representing the core risk library, capturing the outcomes of risk and control self-assessments (RCSAs), outlining proposed risk mitigation actions, and diligently tracking the progress of their implementation. The ultimate goal is to provide an actionable blueprint that EU banks can adopt to strengthen their IT and IS risk management capabilities and navigate the complex regulatory landscape with greater confidence.
2. Defining the Risk Classification Framework: Tailoring to the EU Regulatory Environment
The establishment of a standardized and comprehensive risk classification framework is a foundational prerequisite for the development of an effective risk library. Without a consistent taxonomy, the processes of risk identification, assessment, aggregation, and reporting become fragmented and prone to inconsistencies. A well-defined risk classification framework ensures that all relevant risks are captured in a systematic manner, minimizing the potential for oversights and facilitating a shared understanding of risk across the organization. Furthermore, definitional clarity within the taxonomy is essential to prevent overlaps between risk categories, ensuring that each identified risk is appropriately classified and managed.
To be truly effective within the EU banking sector, the chosen risk classification framework must not only be comprehensive but also closely aligned with the specific requirements and guidance provided by various EU regulations. Several established risk taxonomies exist within the financial services industry, often categorizing risks based on their nature, such as strategic, operational, financial, compliance, and reputational risks. While these broad categories provide a useful starting point, a more granular and regulation-focused approach is necessary for managing IT and IS risks in the EU context. The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) places a significant emphasis on the management of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) risks, resilience testing, and the oversight of third-party ICT service providers. This regulatory focus necessitates a detailed classification of ICT-related risks, extending beyond general operational risk categories to include specific areas such as ICT security risk, ICT operational risk, and risks associated with third-party ICT engagements. DORA's mandate for measures encompassing protection, detection, containment, recovery, and repair of ICT-related incidents underscores the need for a risk classification framework capable of distinguishing between these various facets of ICT risk.
Complementing DORA, the NIS 2 Directive aims to bolster overall cybersecurity across the EU by establishing a high common level of security for network and information systems. While DORA is sector-specific to finance, NIS 2 provides a broader cybersecurity framework that EU banks must also adhere to. This necessitates an alignment in risk classification, ensuring that categories such as network security, information security, and incident reporting are explicitly addressed within the bank's risk taxonomy. NIS 2's "all-hazards" approach further implies that the risk classification should encompass a wide spectrum of potential threats, ranging from sophisticated cyberattacks to physical disruptions that could impact IT systems.
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduces another critical dimension to IT and IS risk management in the EU, focusing on the protection of personal data. GDPR's principles of data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, and confidentiality translate into specific IT and IS risks that must be explicitly identified and managed. These include risks related to unauthorized access to personal data, insufficient mechanisms for obtaining and managing consent, violations of data retention policies, and issues arising from cross-border data transfers. Therefore, the risk classification framework must incorporate distinct categories related to data privacy and compliance with GDPR's stringent data processing principles.
Furthermore, the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) imposes specific IT security requirements on banks concerning online payments, the security of customer data, and the implementation of strong customer authentication (SCA). PSD2's focus on securing payment transactions necessitates the inclusion of specific risk categories within the taxonomy that address the technology and processes involved in payment processing. The requirements for Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) and the provision of secure Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) introduce potential risks if these measures are not implemented and maintained effectively, potentially leading to vulnerabilities in payment systems and increased risks of payment fraud.
Finally, the European Banking Authority (EBA) plays a crucial role in harmonizing regulatory standards for financial institutions across the EU, including the issuance of guidelines on ICT and security risk management. These guidelines provide a more detailed interpretation of regulatory expectations for ICT risk management within the banking sector, offering a valuable foundation for constructing a comprehensive risk classification framework. The EBA guidelines cover a broad range of areas, including governance and strategy for ICT risk management, information security policies and procedures, the management of ICT operations, the oversight of ICT projects and changes, business continuity and disaster recovery planning, and the management of risks associated with payment service user relationships. The bank's risk taxonomy should therefore align with the risk categories and areas of focus outlined in these EBA guidelines to ensure comprehensive coverage and regulatory alignment. Considering these various regulatory drivers, a hierarchical risk classification framework tailored for IT and IS risks in EU banks is proposed below:
Table 1: Mapping Proposed Risk Categories to Relevant EU Regulations




Risk Category (Level 1)
Risk Category (Level 2 - Examples)
Relevant EU Regulation(s)
Cybersecurity Risk
Malware Attacks, Phishing, Insider Threats, DDoS Attacks, Data Breaches
DORA, NIS 2, PSD2, EBA Guidelines

This proposed framework provides a starting point for EU banks to categorize their IT and IS risks in a manner that directly addresses the key areas of regulatory concern. The rationale behind these categories is to provide a clear and structured approach to managing the diverse risks inherent in modern banking operations within the EU. It is crucial to recognize that this framework may need further customization by individual banks based on their specific risk profiles, operational complexities, and the unique nuances of their business activities.
3. Data Structures for the Core Risk Library: Representing Risks, Assets, and Controls
The core of the proposed risk library relies on well-defined data structures to represent the fundamental entities involved in IT and IS risk management: Risks, Assets, and Controls. These data structures should be designed to capture relevant information about each entity and their interrelationships, providing a comprehensive and interconnected view of the bank's risk landscape.
The Risk entity should serve as the central element of the library, capturing detailed information about each identified IT and IS risk. Each risk should be assigned a unique Risk ID to facilitate tracking and referencing. A concise Risk Name should provide a clear and immediate understanding of the risk, while the Risk Category field should link the risk to the standardized taxonomy defined in the previous section, ensuring consistency in classification. A more detailed Risk Description should elaborate on the nature of the risk, its potential causes, and possible consequences. The Potential Impact of the risk should be assessed across various dimensions, including financial, reputational, operational, and legal implications. The Likelihood of Occurrence should be evaluated using either a qualitative scale (e.g., Low, Medium, High) or a quantitative measure (e.g., percentage probability). The combination of likelihood and impact should then be used to calculate an Inherent Risk Score, representing the level of risk before considering any mitigating controls. Assigning a Risk Owner ensures accountability for the management of each identified risk. The Date Identified field provides a temporal context for the risk. The Status field should track the current state of the risk (e.g., Open, Closed, Mitigating, Accepted). Crucially, the Relevant EU Regulations field should explicitly link the risk to the specific EU regulations it pertains to, as outlined in Table 1. Finally, the Risk entity should establish relationships with other key entities through foreign key references: Associated Assets (linking to the Asset entity), Associated Controls (linking to the Control entity), and Associated Mitigation Actions (linking to the Mitigation Action entity). This interconnectedness is vital for understanding the broader context of each risk within the risk management framework.
The Asset entity is equally important, as IT and IS risks invariably relate to specific assets. Each asset should be identified by a unique Asset ID. The Asset Name should clearly identify the specific IT or IS component (e.g., Core Banking System, Customer Database, Network Infrastructure). The Asset Type should categorize the asset (e.g., Hardware, Software, Data, Service). A Description field should provide further details about the asset's function and purpose. The Criticality Level of the asset should be assessed (e.g., High, Medium, Low) based on its importance to the bank's operations and potential business impact if compromised. Assigning an Owner ensures responsibility for the asset's security and maintenance. The Location field should specify the asset's logical or physical location. Similar to the Risk entity, the Asset entity should have fields to link to Associated Risks and Associated Controls. A clear understanding and categorization of IT and IS assets are fundamental for effectively identifying and assessing the risks they are exposed to. Different types of assets possess varying vulnerabilities and potential impacts, making this categorization essential for a targeted and efficient risk assessment.
The Control entity represents the safeguards implemented to mitigate identified risks. Each control should have a unique Control ID and a descriptive Control Name (e.g., Multi-Factor Authentication, Data Encryption, Intrusion Detection System). The Control Objective should clearly state the risk(s) that the control is intended to mitigate. A detailed Control Description should explain how the control functions. The Control Type should categorize the control as preventive, detective, or corrective. The Implementation Status should indicate whether the control is currently implemented, planned for implementation, or not yet implemented. The Effectiveness Rating should assess the control's effectiveness in both its design and operation (e.g., High, Medium, Low). Assigning an Owner ensures accountability for the control's maintenance and effectiveness. Finally, the Control entity should link to Associated Risks and Associated Assets. The Control entity should capture not only the description of the control but also its assessed effectiveness and the specific risks and assets it is designed to protect. Evaluating the effectiveness of controls is crucial for determining the residual risk, and linking controls to specific risks and assets ensures that they are appropriately targeted and provide adequate protection.
To fully leverage these entities, it is essential to establish clear relationships between them. These relationships can be one-to-many or many-to-many, reflecting the complex interdependencies within the risk management framework. For instance, a single risk can potentially impact multiple assets, and conversely, a single asset can be vulnerable to various risks. Similarly, multiple controls may be implemented to mitigate a single risk, and a single control might be effective in mitigating several different risks. Specifying appropriate data types for each attribute (e.g., text, integer, date, dropdown) and implementing robust validation rules are also crucial to ensure data integrity and consistency throughout the risk library.
4. Structuring Data for Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) Results: Capturing Assessment Outcomes
Risk and Control Self-Assessments (RCSAs) play a vital role in proactively identifying and evaluating IT and IS risks and the effectiveness of the controls designed to mitigate them. RCSAs empower the organization to gain a deeper understanding of its risk profile, foster a culture of risk awareness, and provide valuable insights that can inform risk mitigation strategies and resource allocation. To effectively capture the outcomes of these assessments within the risk library, a dedicated data structure is required.
Each RCSA should be assigned a unique RCSA ID. The Assessment Date indicates when the assessment was conducted, and the Assessed By field identifies the individual or team responsible for carrying out the assessment. The Assessment Scope should specify the particular department, process, or system that was the focus of the assessment. Crucially, each RCSA record should link to the specific Risk Assessed and Control Assessed within the core risk library. During the RCSA, an Inherent Risk Rating should be assigned, reflecting the level of risk before considering the impact of controls. Separate ratings should be captured for Control Design Effectiveness (assessing how well the control is designed to mitigate the risk) and Control Operating Effectiveness (evaluating how effectively the control functions in practice). Based on these assessments, a Residual Risk Rating should be determined, representing the level of risk remaining after considering the implemented controls. A Risk Acceptance field (Yes/No) can indicate whether the residual risk level is deemed acceptable based on the bank's risk appetite. The Findings/Observations field should provide a detailed qualitative account of the assessment outcomes, highlighting any identified gaps, weaknesses, or areas for improvement. Based on these findings, specific Recommendations for addressing the identified weaknesses should be documented. The Status of Recommendations (e.g., Open, In Progress, Closed) should track the progress of these remediation efforts, along with a Due Date for Recommendations and the Responsibility for Recommendations.
The following table provides a sample structure for capturing RCSA results:

This data structure aims to capture not only the summary ratings but also the crucial qualitative details such as findings and recommendations, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the assessment outcomes. The ratings offer a high-level overview, while the findings and recommendations provide the necessary context and specific actions required to address any identified vulnerabilities. Establishing clear links between the RCSA records and the corresponding Risk and Control entities within the core risk library is essential. This linkage ensures that the assessment results are directly associated with the specific risks and controls they pertain to, creating a cohesive and integrated view of the risk management landscape.
5. Data Structures for Proposed Risk Mitigation Actions: Planning and Assigning Responsibilities
When identified IT and IS risks are deemed to be at an unacceptable level, it is crucial to define clear and actionable risk mitigation plans to bring these risks within the bank's tolerance thresholds. To effectively manage these mitigation efforts, a dedicated data structure is necessary within the risk library.
Each proposed risk mitigation action should be assigned a unique Mitigation Action ID. The Risk ID field should link the action to the specific risk it is intended to address within the core risk library. A clear and concise Action Description should detail the specific steps that need to be taken to mitigate the identified risk. The Priority of the action (e.g., High, Medium, Low) should be determined based on the severity of the risk and the urgency of addressing it. Assigning the action to a specific Assigned To individual or department ensures clear accountability for its implementation. Target Start Date and Target End Date fields should establish a clear timeline for the action's completion. The Status field should track the current progress of the action (e.g., To Do, In Progress, On Hold, Completed). Fields for Estimated Cost and Actual Cost can help in tracking the financial implications of the mitigation efforts. The Expected Outcome field should articulate the desired reduction in risk likelihood or impact that the action is intended to achieve. Finally, audit trail information such as Date Created, Created By, Date Updated, and Updated By should be recorded.
The following table illustrates a sample data structure for risk mitigation actions:

This data structure is designed to ensure that each mitigation action is not only clearly defined but also has assigned ownership, realistic timelines, and measurable expected outcomes. This level of detail promotes accountability and facilitates the tracking of progress towards risk reduction. Establishing a clear link between the Mitigation Action records and the corresponding Risk entity within the core risk library is essential for maintaining a cohesive and integrated view of the risk management process.
6. Data Structures for Tracking Mitigation Progress: Monitoring Implementation and Effectiveness
Once risk mitigation actions have been defined and assigned, it is crucial to monitor their implementation and assess their effectiveness in reducing the targeted risks. This ongoing tracking process is essential for ensuring that mitigation efforts are proceeding as planned and are achieving the desired risk reduction outcomes. A dedicated data structure within the risk library is required to facilitate this progress monitoring.
Each update on the progress of a mitigation action should be recorded with a unique Progress Tracking ID. The Mitigation Action ID field should link the update to the specific mitigation action it pertains to. The Date of Update field records when the progress information was last updated. A Progress Update field should provide a detailed description of the progress made since the last update. The Percentage Completion field can offer a quantitative measure of the action's progress. Fields for Actual Start Date and Actual End Date should record the actual commencement and completion times of the action. Any Challenges Encountered during the implementation process should be documented. The Next Steps field should outline the planned activities for the continuation of the mitigation effort. Importantly, an Effectiveness Assessment field should capture a qualitative evaluation of how effective the implemented action has been in mitigating the targeted risk. The Residual Risk Score field should reflect the updated risk score after the mitigation action has been implemented, allowing for a comparison against the initial inherent risk score and the desired risk reduction. Finally, the Updated By field should identify the individual responsible for providing the progress update.
The following table provides a sample data structure for tracking mitigation progress:

This data structure is designed to enable regular updates on the status of mitigation actions, the documentation of any challenges encountered during implementation, and a critical assessment of the effectiveness of the implemented measures in reducing the targeted risks. Simply tracking whether a mitigation action has been completed is often insufficient. Regular progress updates provide valuable insights into the implementation process, while effectiveness assessments are crucial for determining whether the desired level of risk reduction has been achieved. Establishing a clear link between the Progress Tracking records and the corresponding Mitigation Action entity ensures a seamless flow of information and a comprehensive view of the risk mitigation lifecycle.
7. Conclusion: Implementing an Effective IT and IS Risk Library for Enhanced Resilience and Compliance
The increasing complexity of the IT and IS landscape within the EU banking sector, coupled with stringent and evolving regulatory requirements, necessitates a proactive and structured approach to risk management. This report proposes a comprehensive framework for an IT and IS risk library designed to meet the specific needs of EU banks operating within this challenging environment.
The cornerstone of this framework is a tailored risk classification taxonomy that aligns with key EU regulations, including DORA, NIS 2, GDPR, PSD2, and the EBA Guidelines. This standardized taxonomy provides a consistent language for identifying, categorizing, and managing IT and IS risks across the organization. The report further details the essential data structures for the core risk library, encompassing the representation of Risks, Assets, and Controls, along with their critical attributes and interrelationships. These structures are designed to capture not only the fundamental characteristics of each entity but also their regulatory context and interconnectedness within the broader risk management framework.
To ensure a holistic approach to risk management, the report also proposes specific data structures for capturing the outcomes of Risk and Control Self-Assessments (RCSAs), outlining proposed risk mitigation actions, and meticulously tracking the progress of their implementation. These structures are designed to capture both quantitative and qualitative data, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the bank's risk profile and the effectiveness of its mitigation efforts.
Implementing a risk library based on these proposed data structures offers numerous benefits for EU banks. It will lead to an enhanced understanding and more effective management of IT and IS risks, ultimately strengthening the bank's operational resilience and business continuity. Furthermore, a well-maintained risk library will significantly improve compliance with the complex web of EU regulations, reducing the potential for regulatory sanctions and reputational damage. The structured data and insights provided by the risk library will also enable more informed decision-making regarding investments in risk mitigation strategies and technologies. Finally, the centralized nature of the risk library will foster improved communication and collaboration on risk management activities across different departments and business units within the bank.
For successful implementation, a phased approach is recommended. Initially, the bank should focus on finalizing and adopting the proposed risk classification framework, ensuring buy-in from all relevant stakeholders. Subsequently, the data structures for the core risk library, RCSA results, mitigation actions, and progress tracking can be built, potentially leveraging a dedicated Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) platform to streamline the process and automate workflows. It is crucial to involve key representatives from IT, security, compliance, and various business units throughout the implementation process to ensure that the risk library effectively meets the needs of the entire organization.
In conclusion, the proposed IT and IS risk library is not a static solution but rather a dynamic tool that should be continuously reviewed and updated. As the regulatory landscape evolves, the threat environment changes, and the bank's operational context shifts, the risk library must adapt to remain relevant and effective. By embracing this continuous improvement mindset, EU banks can leverage a robust risk library to enhance their resilience, ensure ongoing compliance, and navigate the future of digital banking with greater confidence.
